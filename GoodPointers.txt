Some Helpful Tips to Get Better Results
=================================================
-Use meaningful test scenarios (use cases are helpful) to construct test plans with 'real-life' test cases.
-Run JMeter on a machine other than that running the application you
are testing.
-Make sure that the machine running JMeter has sufficient network bandwidth, so the network connection has little to no impact on the results. 
Also, the machine running JMeter should have enough computing power (memory, CPU) to generate load.
-Let JMeter Test Plan run for long time periods, hours or days, or for a large number of iterations. This may yield a smaller standard deviation, 
giving better average results. In addition, this practice may test system availability rate and may highlight any decay in server performance.
-Ensure that the application is stable and optimized for one user before testing it for concurrent users.
-Incorporate 'thinking time' or delays using Timers in your JMeter Test Plan.
-Conduct tests under a monitored and controlled environment, to prevent other users from affecting JMeter results.
-Keep a close watch on the four main things: processor, memory, disk,and network.
-Only run JMeter against servers that you are assigned to test, else you may be accused of causing DoS attacks.
